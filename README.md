# Tic-tac-toe-graphics

Tic-Tac-Toe is a pencil and paper, two player game where, the two players, in turn mark the spaces in a 3x3 grid, with their respective symbols, O and X. The player who succeeds in getting three of his in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row wins. If none of them gets three in a row, the game ends in a draw.  Every turn the aim of the player is to either complete his “three” or prevent the other player from completing his “three”.
